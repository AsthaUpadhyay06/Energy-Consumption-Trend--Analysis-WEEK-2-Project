# Week 2 Power BI Project - Energy Consumption Trend Analysis

This repository contains my Week 2 Power BI project, where I have built an interactive dashboard to analyze energy consumption trends using Power BI. The report helps identify patterns, compare usage across categories, and track performance using key metrics.

## Dashboard Highlights

- *Line Chart*: Shows energy consumption trend over time (daily/monthly).
- *Bar Chart*: Compares consumption across categories or regions.
- *KPI Cards*: Display key metrics like total energy used, average usage, and peak consumption.
- *Slicers*: Allow filtering by time, region, or category for dynamic analysis.
- *Interactive Tooltips*: Provide detailed insights on hover.

## Files Included

- Energy_Consumption_Week2.pbix – The main Power BI dashboard file
- data.csv – The source dataset (if applicable)
- screenshots/ – Folder containing dashboard previews (optional)

## How to Use

1. Download the .pbix file.
2. Open it using *Power BI Desktop*.
3. If prompted, refresh the dataset.
4. Interact with visuals using filters and slicers.

## Tools & Technologies

- *Microsoft Power BI*
- *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)*
- *CSV/Excel Data Sources*

## Project Purpose

This project was created as part of *Week 2* of the Power BI learning track, aiming to build data storytelling skills using real-world energy data.
